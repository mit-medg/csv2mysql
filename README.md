==============================================================

Introduction
------------

Many interesting data sets are distributed as "comma-separated value"
(`.csv`) files.  If they are large (e.g., they exceed the capabilities
of a spreadsheet program), it is convenient to load them into a
relational database so that SQL queries can be used to explore them. 
The tool described here reads a set of such files and heuristically
produces a set of MySQL table definitions and `LOAD DATA` statements
that, if sourced in MySQL, will import the data.  Because of its
heuristics, it requires little or no guidance in determining the
appropriate column data types, though there are options specifying
whether the input files contain header lines, whether blank columns are
to be treated as `NULL`, whether the text encoding is `UTF8`, and
whether `UNIQUE KEY` constraints are to be sought. It is also possible
to specify the format of the `.csv` file by giving the comma, quote and
escape characters.

The program is also able to read files that have been gzip'd, though
MySQL is unable to LOAD DATA such files directly, so they will need to
be unzipped in any case.

This program is released under the MIT License (see below) and uses the
**opencsv** package, documented at <http://opencsv.sourceforge.net>. 
Its code is included in the program.  

Using the Program
-----------------

Csv2mysql is implemented in Java, built in Eclipse.  Eclipse can create
a runnable `.jar` file, which can then be invoked as:  

    java -jar csv2mysql.jar [options] file1 file2 ...

The following options are available:  

Option  | Meaning
---- | ------------------------------------------------------
`-c` | Next argument is the *comma* character \[default `,`\]
`-q` | Next argument is the *quote* character \[default `"`\]
`-e` | Next argument is the *escape* character \[default `\`\]
`-o` | Next argument is the output file \[default `mysql_load.sql`\]
`-g` | First line of input files does *not* contain column names; use generated ones
`-b` | Empty columns are *not* treated as `NULL` values, but as themselves; `NULL``s` in MySQL are normally `\N` or `"\N"`
`-u` | Text encoding is `UTF8`
`--utf8mb4` | Text encoding is `UTF8MB4`
`-z` | Integers whose first digit is 0 are treated as strings; distinguishes, e.g., `123` from `0123`
`-k` | For each column, check if all the data values are distinct; create `UNIQUE KEY` constraints for those that are, except floating-point values; this is slow for very large data sets
`-f` | if `-k`, also tries to find `UNIQUE KEY`s for floats
`-m` | Maximum number of distinct values to track in a column \[default 1,000,000\]      
`-p` | Report progress during scan of the data.  If multiple input files are specified, the program reports processing of each one, and prints a "." for every 100,000 lines of the input file that are read.  If `-k` is also given, it reports each time it has determined that a certain column of data is *not* unique.

If the program is run with no arguments, it prints the above
information.

Heuristics
----------

The program reads through all of the input data, one file at a time. 
Each file is processed separately, so there is no attempt to assure
consistency among different tables.  The data types that are recognized
are described in the following sub-sections.  

### NULLs

Empty fields in the input data are treated as `NULL` unless the `-b` option
is given; in that case, it is treated as an empty string, and `NULL` must be
denoted by `\N` or `"\N"`.

If none of the entries in
a column are `NULL`, we specify `NOT NULL` for the column.  

### Integers

An integer is an optional `+` or `-` sign followed by any number of the
digits 0-9.  (We have no provisions for any radix other than 10.) MySQL
has multiple integer data types of different sizes:  

| MySQL Type | Maximum Signed Value | Minimum Signed Value | Maximum Unsigned Value |
| --- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| `TINYINT` | `127` | `-128` | `255`  | 
| `SMALLINT` | `32767` | `-32768` | `65535` |
| `MEDIUMINT` | `8388607` | `-8388608` | `16777215` |
| `INT` | `2147483647` | `-2147483648` | `4294967295` |
| `BIGINT` | `9223372036854775807` | `-9223372036854775808` | `18446744073709551615` |
| `DECIMAL` | `10^66 - 1` (65 "9"'s)` | `-10^66 + 1` | `10^66 - 1` |
---

We choose the column data type that minimally fits the range of values
seen.  If they are all non-negative, we choose `UNSIGNED` types.

For some data, fields that include integers that begin with `0` are
meant to be treated as code strings, not integers.  The `-z` switch
specifies this option. In that case, `0`, `+0` and `-0` are still
treated as the integer `0`, but items like `007`, `+03` and `-0999`
are taken to be strings.

### Floating-point

A floating point value is specified as an optional sign, a series of
digits with possibly one decimal point among them, optionally followed
by `E`, an optional sign, and a series of digits representing the power
of 10 in scientific notation. We choose to represent such floating point
values as one of the following MySQL types depending on their range of
values:  

| MySQL Type | Largest Negative | Smallest Negative | Smallest Positive | Largest Positive |
| --- | ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|
| `FLOAT` | `-3.402823466E+38` | `-1.175494351E-38` | `1.175494351E-38` | `3.402823466E+38` |
| `DOUBLE` | `-1.7976931348623157E+308` | `-2.2250738585072014E-308` | `2.2250738585072014E-308` | `1.7976931348623157E+308` | 

Note that an integer can also appear in a floating-point field, but
will be treated as floating-point if not all values in that field are
integers.  If all the values in a field fit within a `FLOAT`, that type
will be selected; otherwise, `DOUBLE`.  In principle, we could also
support larger `DECIMAL` fields, but do not do so.

### Date, Time and DateTime

MySQL provides Date, Time and DateTime data types, which we support. 
There is also a TimeStamp data type, but its range is much more limited
than in other implementation such as Oracle, so we do not consider that
possibility but use DateTime instead.  If every value in a field is `NULL` or a
valid Date, Time, or DateTime, then the field will be declared with that
data type.

Dates are normally written as `YYYY-MM-DD`, 
though two-digit years
or dates using `/` instead of `-` as a separator are also allowed. 
Times are written in 24-hour notation, as `HH:MI:SS` possibly followed by
a decimal fractional second; the separators are either a colon, period or
dash.  A DateTime is a date specification followed by either a space or
the character `T`, followed by a time specification.  Invalid dates or
times are not considered to be dates or times and will probably cause the
field to be interpreted as a text field.  Timezones are not handled.

As a special case, we also recognize dates and times in a format often
used in exporting from Oracle, which is of the form `15-jan-2015
14:30:25`.  That may be followed by a space and a time zone specificiation
(e.g., `EST`).  If a column consistently codes an Oracle style date, time or
datetime/timestamp, we arrange to translate it on input into the SQL standard
format, but ignore the time zone portion, if any.

### Character

Data fields all of whose values cannot be parsed as any of the other
data types are treated as character types.  These may be surrounded by
quotes but need not be, unless they contain characters (such as
quotation marks) that can confuse the reader.  MySQL supports various
lengths of character fields.  We use the following:  

| MySQL Type | Maximum Length | Maximum Length if UTF8 |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| `VARCHAR(255)` | `255` | `84` |
| `TINYTEXT` (*not used* because it is equivalent to `VARCHAR(255)`) | `255` | `84` |
| `TEXT` | `65535` | `21844` |
| `MEDIUMTEXT` | `16777215` | `5592402` | 
| `LONGTEXT` | `4294967295L` | `1431655765` |

We choose the field that is minimally able to store all values of a
field.  For convenience, we also output the longest value as a comment
in the table definition.  

### Unique Keys

The options `-k`, `-f`, and `-m` control heuristics for recognizing
`UNIQUE KEY` constraints. These define indexes that make data
retrieval efficient.  MySQL allows multiple `NULL` values in fields
with unique keys, which is different from some other
databases. `UNIQUE KEY` constraints are created (if `-k` is specified) 
for any column in which each non-`NULL` value is distinct from all
other values in that field.  Distinctness varies somewhat depending on
the type of the field.

#### Integers

If a column has all integer values, we test for distinctness by
actually converting each value to integers. This is because although
`001` and `1` are distinct as strings, they are identical as
integers. (But see the `-z` option.)

#### Floats

Fields whose values are all `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE` are considered for a
`UNIQUE KEY` only if the `-f` option is given, because in ordinary
usage one may not find all distinct values of such fields
meaningful. We collect all the string representations of a floating
point column and determine that no unique key can exist if these are
not all distinct. In addition, we then convert each value to a Java
`Double` to test if the values are truly distinct, because, for
instance, `3` and `3.0` are the same floating-point value even though
they are textually distinct.

#### Text

MySQL (as of version 5.7) is able to index only the first 767 bytes of
a text field. That limit would make it hard to consider distinctness
of longer strings.  In fact, we limit recognition of `UNIQUE KEY`
constraints on text fields to those that can be encoded in a
`VARCHAR(255)` column, which can hold a maximum of 255 ASCII
characters or 85 UTF8 characters. Indexing by very long text fields is
probably not very valuable in any case, because they are unlikely to
be used to look up data.

#### Dates and Times

It may be possible to write the same Date, Time, or Datetime in
multiple ways.  For example, in a Datetime, the character separating
the date and time components may be either a space or a `T`.
Therefore, textual difference among values may not indicate a true
difference in values. Therefore, we should check (as for integers and
floats) whether all values are actually distinct.  However, we do not
do so, and expect that resulting errors (i.e., defining a `UNIQUE KEY`
constraints on a temporal column that in fact has such non-unique
values will be exceptionally rare, and will represent a failure of
this heuristic.

#### Limitations on seeking unique keys

We are able to maintain efficiently a representation of many distinct
integer values if they are dense enough to allow us to represent them
as a tree of ranges, which can be merged when they meet.  This is
often the case for identifiers or serial numbers.  Because other data
types are not "dense" in this sense, we must actually keep all
distinct values in order to be able to recognize a non-unique one. 
This explodes memory for very large tables, so we limit to a maximum
number of distinct values for each column (see `-m`
\[default 1M\]). Because the program stops looking for duplicates
after that limit (except for integers), it cannot determine whether a
column can have a `UNIQUE KEY`, so it assumes not.

If very large limits are given on `-m` or if a very large number of
sparse integer values are found, it may be necessary to increase
memory limits on the Java `jvm` using the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` options.

Caveats
-------

The above heuristics may not create the intended data types.  For example,
some coding systems do distinguish between codes "001" and "01", but if
every code in a column can be interpreted as an integer, this program
will do so unless `-z` is specified, and thus lose these distinctions.

The program also cannot determine which among the `UNIQUE KEY`s should
be a table's `PRIMARY KEY`, or whether compound keys need to be defined
to reflect the semantics and/or access patterns to the data.  It is also
unable to identify `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.

Even with extra memory, seeking unique keys on very large data sets becomes
quite slow.  Thus, rather than using the `-k` option, it may be more
sensible to run without it, load the data into the database system, and
then check to see whether all values are distinct using its facilities. 
If so, `ALTER TABLE` can create the `UNIQUE KEY` constraints.
